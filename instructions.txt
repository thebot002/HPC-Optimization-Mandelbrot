The exam of the course consists in submitting (in group) and discussing (individually) one (and only one) of the following proposals.

1) The three homeworks, maximum grade 25.

2) The parallelisation (again in openMP, MPI and CUDA) of a program TO BE DEFINED. Maximum grade 30 cum laude (30L). 
The homeworks can be submitted and evaluated up to 3 points to increase the evaluation of this project. 

3) The parallelisation of an algorithm proposed by you. You need to discuss it with me to have the proposal approved.  Same rules as 2)


Note: it is possible to achieve 30L also only submitting the parallelisation of the main project (hereafter MP, i.e.  Mandelbrot or the algorithm proposed for 3). 
The homeworks (hereafter H) can provide you more points only in case you get less than 30L considering only MP. 
So MP evaluated 25 + H means a final grade of up to 28, MP evaluated 28 + H means a final grade of up to 30L, MP evaluated 30L means you did H for the satisfaction to do them ;)

The time limit is SEPTEMBER 2023.

 Send me report+code at least one week before you want to discuss the project (not August and, in general, holidays) and pass the exam.

Note: a group can be composed by 1 or 2 or 3 students. Groups of 4 students can be considered only if they propose a sufficiently complex project.     

Consider different values for resolution and iteration starting from 1000 to show meaningful scalability and speedup values.
